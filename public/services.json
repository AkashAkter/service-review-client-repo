        "details": "Travel photography is the broadest photography genre in terms of all the different subjects it covers. It encompasses numerous other areas of photography, such as street, landscape, or architecture photography. This is why it takes a lot more than mere photographic knowledge to excel as a travel photographer. A good travel photographer must be flexible, well-organized and outgoing. Flexible to adapt to time-related challenges (e.g. waking up early, staying up late). Well-organized to plan photographic trips to the last detail. Outgoing because, well, you can go a long way with a smile if you plan to, say, take portraits of total strangers in faraway lands. Learning a foreign language or three wouldn't hurt either. However, there's something unique about travel photography that makes it stand out from all other photography genres. The purpose of travel photography goes beyond just shooting a spectacular image. Travel photography is a means to tell a story, to inspire, and, above all, to educate people on the diversity of our beautiful world.",

        "details": "More specific than working in advertising, product photography is a great specialization. Think about all of the products you have recently shopped for: everything needs to be photographed. The photos are used for online and print catalogs, as well as for labels and packaging. Most product photography is studio based, with careful control of backgrounds, shadows, and lighting. Studio rentals can be fairly expensive so consider building a home photography studio on a budget. Product photography covers a lot of ground. Food photography is a specialized niche, and restaurants need to advertise their meals and create their menus. Jewelry is another favorite type of product photography since this requires the perfect balance of light and preparation. While some product shoots might involve models, many times you will be working solo in a studio doing still life photographs of small objects.",

It can include shooting building exteriors and interiors, as well as bridges, other structures, and cityscapes.Architectural photography is a genre of photography that focuses on capturing photographs of buildings or structures. Hence, it also involves photographing the interiors and exteriors of buildings, bridges, structures, and cityscapes. When compared to other photography fields, this kind of photography is less dynamic as it demands you to spend a lot of time contemplating over a scene or an environment. As a result, you may not need a speedy or continuous shooting mode camera. Still, you will have to focus on the image's quality. Additionally, you must be ready to use the editing tools, know how to fit a building into a frame, and integrate the rules of composition. Architectural photography was born in the 1870's when the famous architectural photographer Albert Levy began to click photos of older buildings. Later, modern buildings were photographed by the American mid-century modernist Julius Shulman.",

Even though the subject doesn't show expressions like a human portrait model, capturing a vehicle in a creative way requires a lot of work - lighting, composition, post-production - it's a highly-skilled process, and as such, well-remunerated at the commercial level. Also known as car photography or vehicle photography, automotive photography is a deceptively challenging field. Photographers in this niche are specialists in capturing the best features of every vehicle they work with and help to build stunning photographs that speak to the emotions of the viewer. Photographers in this field typically work with car, van, truck, and other vehicle manufacturers to create advertising campaigns for their newest models. Many automotive photographers may also work with used car dealerships to build a gallery of images for websites and social media.",

The Sun is located on one of the spiral arms, about 25,000 light-years away from the center of the galaxy. The aperture is the first setting that you have to adjust before taking pictures of the Milky Way. To capture our galaxy, it's key to use the best exposure settings to photograph the Milky Way: the aperture, ISO, and shutter speed. The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System. From our vantage point on Earth, we see it as a noticeable band of light stretching across the night sky. Usually, when people talk about photographing the Milky Way, they are referring to the dense core of the galaxy towards the constellation Sagittarius.",
